## Step 1: Simple API

### Create a linode

Go to linode.com. Create or access account. Create a ubuntu linode, start with a shared cpu Nanode. Create and/or add ssh. 

### Excurse ssh

If you run a windows system, get the ubuntu subsystem from the windows store. Start the ubuntu subsystem. A terminal window opens and you have a linux distribution on your windows machine! On Linux or MacOS simply start a terminal.

Now create the key pair on the client machine (your computer). The key pair consists of a public and a private key. You can share the public key, but keep the private key secret. You can create the key pair with following command:

```
$ ssh-keygen
```

Just accept the file location with yes. The location will be the .ssh directory in your personal home directory /home/username.

Enter a passphrase to secure your ssh key-pair.
Now you can place the public key on your linode server. To copy the public key, change to the .ssh directory.

```
$ cd ~/.ssh
```

Now list the files in the .ssh directory with

```
$ ls
```

You should see see two files with names starting with id_
One of the files ends with the .pub file extension, e. g. id_ed25519.pub
This is your public key, that you can share. To copy it, write the following command:

```
cat id_ed25519.pub
```

Your key is now displayed in the terminal. Mark the text of the key and copy it with SHIFT-CTRL-c.
Now open linode.com and go to your dashboard. At the right of your linode you see three dots. Click on the dots and choose "Rebuild" to make changes to SSH. Under SSH Keys click the button "Add a SSH Key" and follow the instructions to add your public key to the SSH Keys of your Linode.

Now you shoul be able to ssh from your computer into your linode.

### Harden the linode server

#### Update and Upgrade

Visit your linode via ssh (for xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx use the ip address of your linode):

```
ssh root@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
```

Update and upgrade your linode: 

```
apt update && apt dist-upgrade -y
```

To initialize the updates, rebbot the linode server.

```
reboot
```

 After rebooting, ssh again into the server.

```
ssh root@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
```

It is important to keep our server updated on a regular basis. To make this a little bit easier, let us use a package to do the job automatically for us. 

```
sudo apt install unattended-upgrades
```

To use the package, write following command:

```
dpkg-reconfigure --priority=low unattended-upgrades
```

#### PermitRootLogin, AllowUsers and PasswordAuthenticaion

For the security of the application it it recommended to create a specific user for the server and do not allow root to make changes to the system. Add this with only ssh access without password authentification to avoid password brute force attacks.

It is time to create the new user 'pocketa' for the application:

```
adduser pocketa
```

Type in the New password for the new user pocketa and confirm the password. If you wish, fill out the next questions or simply press Enter to leave it blank. Confirm your input data with Yes. 

Now add the new user pocketa to the sudo group: 

```
usermod -aG sudo pocketa
```

The user pocketa has now sudo privileges. We want to make our server more secure and in that case, won't allow root to access the server any more. And we want to access our server only via ssh, not via password. To achieve this, we are going to change sshd-config. But first, let us prepare the change of the config-file.

First, change account to user pocketa via

```
su - pocketa
```

You should now see, that you are "pocketa@localhost" instead of "root@localhost".

Second, copy your ssh public key to the server. You need the ip-address of your linode. Inside the server, you are pocketa@localhost, but from outside the server, you are pocketa@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, with xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx as the ip-address of your linode. You need to logout from the server with CTRL-d. Now you should be back in your client machine. Now copy your public ssh key to the linode server via

```
ssh-copy-id pocketa@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
```

Try to login to the linode server without to input the password on the serverside. (If you have protected your ssh key on the client side, of course you have to input your password on client side.) Try to ssh into the linode server with

```
ssh pocketa@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
```

Granted access to the server without the input of a password on serverside? Great job! Now we can establish the access exclusivly via ssh and don't allow root-access. For this, open the config-file via

```
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd-config
``` 

Search for the line with "PermitRootLogin yes" and change it to "PermitRootLogin no".

Add in a new line "AllowUsers pocketa" to just allow user 'pocketa' access to the server.

Now search for the line with "PasswordAuthentication yes" and change it to "Password Authentication no".
Save the file and quit vim.

To make the changes work, restart the ssh daemon (sshd) with the command:

```
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

Logout and try to access via 

```
ssh root@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
```

It should not be possible. Now try to access via

```
ssh pocketa@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
```

You should be able to access the server. If you have any problems entering the linode server, you can enter it via the lish console as root and make changes at the sshd-config. Just go over to linode.com and entervia lish-console.

If everything works as expected: Congratulations! You have now access to your application server from your client machine and with a more solid security layer.
